## Modeling and Simulation of the Drag Free Control of GOCE Spacecraft
Project developed for the course 'Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Systems'.

## Abstract
The **_DFAC_** system is modeled considering only the translational dynamics along the direction of the spacecraft's velocity.  
The _physical model_ includes an **accelerometer**, a **flow control valve**, and an **ion thruster**.
The system is simulated in **nominal conditions** and in **off-nominal conditions** (including the simulation of **failures** and a **sensitivity analysis**).
The fine-tuning of the gains of the controllers is performed through a simple system **optimization**.
