Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Systems (2020/2021)
Project: GOCE
Authors: Giulio Pacifici, Lorenzo Porcelli, Giacomo Velo (group 3)

The folder of the project contains three elements: a 'functions' folder, a
'scripts' folder and a main script. Please use the main script to run the 
different tasks of the assignment. The tasks are: main simulation, 
simulation with failures, linearization with Symbolic Toolbox, sensitivity
analysis, analysis of the numerical integration, optimization. It is possible
to show the plots of the results by running the last section of the main.

It is possible to select the simulation type to be run directly from main by
switching the symType variables between 0 and 1 (1: run task; 0: do not 
run task). All are active by default in the delivered code. Next to the 
definition of the symTyme, an estimation of the required computational time
of the specific simulation is present. The time is computed with a laptop
equipped with an Intel Core i5-8250U + 8GB RAM.
